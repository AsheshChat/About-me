Hi, I’m Ashesh Chaturvedi

I’m an undergraduate Computer Science (Cybersecurity) student at UOWD, passionate about cryptography, penetration testing, and secure software design.
My GitHub showcases projects where I’ve combined theory and practice across programming, algorithms, and security.

🔐 What I Do
	•	Build and explore encryption tools (RSA, modular arithmetic, AES basics)
	•	Analyze risks and vulnerabilities using Python and security tools (Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite)
	•	Design data-driven apps in Java, Python, and C++ with real-world APIs and GUIs
	•	Work on CTFs (picoCTF) and virtual internships (Deloitte Cybersecurity on Forage)

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Languages: Python, C++, Java, SQL
	•	Security Tools: Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite (beginner), OpenSSL
	•	Concepts: Cryptography, data structures & algorithms, databases

🚀 Selected Projects
	•	🔑 RSA Encryption Tool – Implemented RSA keygen, encryption/decryption, brute-force analysis
	•	📊 Risk Score Calculator – GUI-based tool modeling vulnerabilities and antivirus strength
	•	🌍 Real-time Earthquake Viewer – Java Swing app fetching live USGS earthquake data
	•	🧬 DNA Structure Analysis – C++ algorithms for pattern detection in genomic sequences
	•	🎵 Spotify-like SQL Platform – Database project with queries for songs, artists, and rankings
